== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is CoinTent? =
CoinTent is a digital wallet service that allows publisher to sell content how they want to. Publisher can select to sell via subscriptions, limited-access passes, or a la carte for prices as low as $0.05

= How does CoinTent work? =
Publishers integrate the CoinTent plugin and determine at what price and how they want to sell their content.  This displays the button that allows users to pay for content.  To purchase content, end consumers with an account can purchase content with one click.  End consumers without an account can sign-up for an account and fund their wallet while staying on your website, and then continue to purchase content.

= What does the plugin handle? =
The plugin adds a paywall to the premium posts. Clicking the purchase button in the paywall handles the user setting up an account, funding that account, buying the article and saving their purchase history.

= Why do I have to agree to tracking? =
Tracking help us improve the reader's experience. We relay this data back to you so you can test different prices and see what content people are most willing to pay for. It is anonymous, we are looking at aggregate numbers not individual users. We track views of posts, clicks on our purchase buttons, and click on user's logging in. We use that tracking to compare against the number of readers that sign up for our service, and we use that information to guide our choices on what appears in the box. We also use this tracking to make sure we don't have any bugs in the product, changes in the numbers help us see bugs even before they are reported to get them fixed ASAP.  We don't use this data to sell to anyone else, it is used to make our product the best it can be and to help your business.
