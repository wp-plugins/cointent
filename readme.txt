Reader Tracking

Help us improve the reader's experience by turning on anonymous reader tracking.  We track views of posts, clicks on our purchase buttons, and click on user's logging in. We use that tracking to compare against the number of readers that signup for our service, and we use that information to guide our choices on what appears in the box.  We relay this data back to you so you can test different prices and see what content people are most willing to pay for.

We also use this tracking to make sure we don't have any bugs in the product, changes in the numbers help us see bugs even before they are reported to get them fixed ASAP.  We don't use this data to sell to anyone else, it is used to make our product the best it can be and to help your business.
