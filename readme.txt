== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is CoinTent? =
CoinTent is a digital wallet service that allows publisher to sell content the way they want to. Publisher can select to sell via subscriptions, limited-access passes, or a la carte for prices as low as $0.05.

= How does CoinTent work? =
Publishers install the CoinTent plugin and determine the content they’d like to sell, and the  price they’d like to charge. The plugin blocks access to the content, and displays a button that allows users to pay for the content. To purchase content, consumers with an account can purchase content with one click. Consumers without an account can sign-up for an account and fund their wallet while staying on your website, and then continue to purchase content in a fluid user experience.

= What does the plugin handle? =
The plugin adds a paywall to the premium posts. Clicking the purchase button in the paywall handles the user setting up an account, funding that account, buying the article and saving their purchase history.

= How do I integrate the CoinTent plugin? =
Check out our [step-by-step guide](https://cointent.com/docs/wordpress?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_term=readme&utm_campaign=documentation) or email <support@cointent.com> for more help.

= What content can I sell? =
You can sell any content: articles, blog posts, videos, etc.  Just wrap the content you want to hide in the "cointent_lockedcontent" shortcode and any content before the more tag will be paywalled. More information is available in our [documentation](https://cointent.com/docs/wordpress?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_term=readme&utm_campaign=documentation).

= How do I make an article available for sale? =
There are two ways to designate an article for sale. You can either pick a WordPress category and make all posts in that category for sale, or you can add the CoinTent shortcode to the individual article you want to sell. More information is available in our [documentation](https://cointent.com/docs/wordpress?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_term=readme&utm_campaign=documentation).

= Why do I have to agree to tracking? =
Tracking is core to reporting your financial success.  Data from your individual visitors is anonymous and aggregated, yet helps you test different prices and see what content people are most willing to pay for. We track views of posts, clicks on our purchase buttons, and click on user's logging in. We use that data to compare against the number of readers that sign up for our service, and to guide our choices on the appropriate presentation of the checkout process. We also use this data to make sure we do not have any bugs in the product. Changes in the numbers help us see bugs even before they are reported so we can fix them before they affect many users. We don't use this data to sell to anyone else, it is used to make our product the best it can be and to help your business.

= Can I choose the price of each of my articles? =
Yes, the prices are defaulted to $0.25 and can be changed in your [account dashboard](https://cointent.com/p/account?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_term=readme&utm_campaign=faq).

= Do I need a CoinTent Publisher Account? =
Yes, your CoinTent publisher account serves as your dashboard for setting prices for your articles, monitoring your sales, and requesting a payment of your balance.  A publisher account also allows us to keep you informed of our Terms of Service. You can sign up on [CoinTent.com](https://cointent.com/p/signup?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_term=readme&utm_campaign=faq).

= What is the cost structure? =

Please refer to our [pricing page](https://cointent.com/pricing?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_term=readme&utm_campaign=faq) for more details.
